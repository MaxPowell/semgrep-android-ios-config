# Semgrep Android/iOS bad config rules
Semgrep regex rules to detect insecure configurations in Android or iOS. I'm trying this from the scratch and just for fun, so there may be many thigs to improve.

At the moment, semgrep can't parse XML or .plist documents, so I'm using regex to trynna catch every each case.
